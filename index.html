                    <h3>Working as a student</h3>
                    <p>2014 - 2017</p>
                </header>
                <p>While still in school i always wanted to earn my own money, so I worked many of my holidays at
                    the
                    construction yard of our local community. Besides that, i started working as a waiter for 2
                    years
                    while in class 11 and 12. This gave me the freedom to do my work and travel year in australia.

                    <h3>Work and Travel Australia</h3>
                    <p>October 2017 - July 2018</p>
                </header>
                <p>Right after finishing my a-level, i went to australia to travel, meet nice people and experience
                    different cultures.
                    to fund my trip i worked on several farms like for example a cattle and wheat farm, a raspberrie
                    farm, a watermelon farm or lemon and grape picking on different farms. I travelled from Melbourne up
                    the east coast to Cairns, while living in a car i bought together with a guy named Trung, that i met
                    at my first farm job.
                    We also visited Tasmania and made our Diving license, which we used later to discover the Great
                    Barrier Reef

                    <h3>Sportstherapist for neurological patients at Sachsenklinik Bad Lausick</h3>
                    <p>January 2022 - February 2023</p>

                <p>
                    After finishing my bachelors degree in "Präventions-, Rehabilitations- und Fitnesssport" at TU
                    Chemnitz, I started working as a Sportstherapist. I found my first job at "Sachsenklinik" in Bad
                    Lausick. There I trained people with neurological deseases like
                    strokes, Parkinson`s desease or multiple sclerosis, with the goal of getting their movements back to
                    normal or as close to it as possible.

                    <h3>Fitnesscoach and Sportstherapist at proagil Mittweida</h3>
                    <p>June 2023 - December 2023</p>

                <p>
                    After more then one year in the rehabilitation side of my bachelors degree, I wanted to also try out
                    the prevention and fitness part as well. So applied at a local fitnessstudio, the proagil in
                    Mittweida. There i gave more active courses in front of a younger audience with the goal of building
                    up muscle, but still had some courses with elderly people training them in order not to fall or
                    prevent pain.
